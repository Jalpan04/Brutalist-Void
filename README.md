# The Brutalist Void

**An infinite, procedurally generated brutalist city exploration experience.**

This project simulates an endless walk through a megastructure composed of massive concrete slabs, pillars, and citadels. It emphasizes atmosphere, scale, and the "liminal" horror of empty architectural spaces.

## 🌑 Features

### 🏗️ Procedural Architecture
- **Infinite World**: The city generates endlessly as you walk.
- **Megastructures**: Logic-driven generation of Citadels, Housing Slabs, Plazas, and Grid Arrays.
- **Binary Space Partitioning**: Scientific approach to block division for realistic street layouts.
- **Geometric Details**: Giant abstract statues, hanging cables ("The Wires"), and recessed building features.

### 🌫️ Atmospheric Shaders
- **Volumetric Fog**: Dense, distance-based fog that hides the horizon.
- **Dynamic Lighting**: 
  - **Liminal Mode**: Bright, hazy, overcast day.
  - **Creepy Mode**: Dark, blue-grey night with warm flickering window lights.
- **Material Effects**: procedural concrete texture, reflective black liquid pools, and glowing neon graffiti.

### 🎥 Cinematic Tools
- **Auto-Pilot Drone (`P`)**: Activates an AI camera that walks and looks around cinematically, avoiding obstacles.
- **Built-in Recording (`R`)**: Pipes raw frames directly to FFmpeg for high-quality video capture.

## 🎮 Controls

| Key | Action |
| :--- | :--- |
| **W A S D** | Move |
| **Space** | Jump / Fly (Verticality) |
| **Mouse** | Look |
| **Ctrl** | Toggle Lighting Mode (Liminal / Creepy) |
| **P** | Toggle Cinematic Auto-Pilot |
| **R** | Toggle Recording (Start/Stop) |
| **F11** | Toggle Fullscreen |

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Languages**: C++17, GLSL (Shaders)
- **Engine**: Raylib 5.0
- **Build System**: Custom Batch Script (`build.bat`) with g++

## 📦 How to Build
1. Ensure `g++` (MinGW) is in your PATH.
2. Run `build.bat`.
3. Execute `bin/brutalist_void.exe`.

## 📹 Recording
Press **R** to start recording. The engine pipes raw RGBA frames to `ffmpeg` (must be installed/in path) to create `recording.mp4` in the game directory. Resolution matches your window/fullscreen size.
